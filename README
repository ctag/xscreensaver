                             a collection of
                            free screen savers
                            for X11 and MacOS

===============================================================================

This is the XScreenSaver source code distribution.  It is strongly recommended
that you install a binary release rather than trying to compile it yourself.
Binaries are available for almost all platforms, including MacOS X.  See the
XScreenSaver web site for details.

To compile on a Unix system with X11:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

To compile on MacOS X:

    Use the included XCode project.  Requires XCode 4 and MacOS X 10.5
    or newer.

Interested in writing a new screen saver?

    See the README.hacking file.

See the parent of this repo for the rest of the normal README

I'm also maintaining the AUR for this little excursion:
https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/xscreensaver-xmatrix-color/

Currently I've
- Added basic XBM/XPM color support to xmatrix
- Changed the way xmatrix calculates density to allow more precision

I still plan to
- Support detailed color remapping
- Custom fonts?
- Bring basic colors over to matrix-gl?

Notes

My setup process for testing xmatrix (from the Archlinux PKGBUILD):

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var \
    --libexecdir=/usr/lib --with-x-app-defaults=/usr/share/X11/app-defaults \
    --with-pam --with-login-manager --with-gtk --with-gl \
    --without-gle --with-pixbuf --with-jpeg
    make
    ./hacks/xmatrix -small

For some reason that I don't believe to be my fault, when I try to run

    make clean

I get an error:

    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
    
    * What went wrong:
    A problem occurred configuring project ':GLWallpaperService'.

Weird, I don't know any user named jwz on my system... Maybe I should post to
jwz.org/blog/ about it, except I'm not really willing to be laughed at.

In the mean time, I just remove OSX and andrdoid directories from the Makefile,
wasn't looking for android or mac usage anyway.
